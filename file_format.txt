*Notice* it is the responsibility of the screen designer to make sure that the & is placed in a position not accessible by the creatures !

    // Format of steps files:

Each line represents a single gameloop (a Point of Time).
Each object that is currently moving will appear in the line, as a name and his direction.
For example:

Pacman: a Ghost0: d Ghost1: d Ghost2: d
or
Fruit: w Pacman: a

Each letter represents the direction:
a = Left
w = Up
d = Right
x = Down
s = Stay

also, if a New Fruit Spawned, at the end of the line, after all of the current gameloop moves, the line will look like this:
Fruit new Position: X: 1,Y: 11
X and Y represents a position on the board which the new Fruit has Spawned at.


    // Format of result files:

In case Pacman has died in this screen, there will be a line with the gameloop when he died. 
For example:

Pacman died: 85

In case the Pacman has finished the screen the last line of the file will look like this:

Pacman Finished the Screen: 59

Each file ends with an empty line.
